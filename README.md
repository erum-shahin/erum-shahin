### 🌱 What I'm Learning Right Now
I believe in mastering the basics first. Currently, I am:
- 💻 **Deep Diving into C:** Mastering loops, arrays, and memory management to understand how code works "under the hood."
- 🧠 **Logic Building:** Solving algorithmic problems to improve my problem-solving skills.
- 🛠️ **Version Control:** Using Git and GitHub to document every step of my journey.
